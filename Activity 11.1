1. Create a dictionary of terms. You can use any theme you want: Python keywords, math terms, slang you know, music groups, 
whatever. Put at least five entries in your dictionary.

2. Display the value of one of the terms using the [key] method.

3. Display the value using the .get method.

4. Write to print out all of the values in the dictionary.

5. Write a loop that goes through all of the keys in the dictionary (just like in 4). If the key is 'pie' print out 
"I like pie". Note that your dictionary does not have to have the key 'pie' in it.
